#### Analysis

Initial analysis to check for the dependency of variables and their significance in determining the number of incentives available across various shows vastly different trends and unreliable significance levels of variables affecting the dependent value. An additional variable was added which represented the political scenario of the state (Democratic or Republican). This variable turned out to be highly significant in predicting both CO2 emissions per capita and the number of incentive programs available in each state.  On average, states with Democratic majority had between 36.80 to 48.81 additional incentive programs across various models and an increase of 40.3 programs on the best model while being significant at levels of well over 99% across all models.

#### Some of the interesting trends that were observed were -
The location of the states largely affects both dependant variables in consideration. Geographic proximity does seem to affect energy policies.
States having a coast showed consistent trends of reduced CO2 emissions and better energy policies, the causation of this can be attributed to the presence of major urban centres on the coats (both East and West).
Contrary to common belief, effects of factors like GDP, population, price of certain fuels were inconclusive in nature with reduced to varying levels of statistical significance.
The strong correlation between CO2 emissions per capita and the state of energy policies go on to prove that effective policy can indeed help persuade the population to switch to greener methods thereby reducing carbon emissions. This makes it extremely important to spread awareness of the programs which are already in place.

#### Building off of our research
One of our major analysis points are the strong correlation between political alignment and number of energy policies and incentives. This correlation makes logical sense, but it’s a very significant variable compared to the other variables we explored. Although a general correlation between political alignment and energy policy has been established, further research into this matter would explore in more detail the nature of this correlation. This analysis treated political alignment of the state as a boolean variable: further analysis could treat the political alignment variable as a wide spectrum, since some states are more left or right-leaning than other states. If there’s a strong correlation between political alignment and energy policy, there is a great possibility that there is more details like this to be discovered in the data.
Our second major analysis point is the correlation between CO2 emissions per capita and the number of energy regulations and incentives was not as expected as the first correlation identified. Immediately, one question is posed in response: Is this a result of the energy policies put into place, or is CO2 emissions a variable that influences a state’s decision to put more energy policies in place? This naturally leads to further analysis: A more complex empirical model designed to accurately show CO2 emissions per capita’s influence on the number of energy policies would be greatly beneficial to understanding why this correlation between the variables exists, and the nature of this link.


### Data 

#### DSIRE
Policies & Incentives by States
This database provides all the current incentives and policies mandated by law at a state level. These included financial incentives, regulatory policies, and technical resources. The majority of the financial incentives were rebate offers on additions or upgrades that increase energy efficiency in a commercial or residential environment. Additionally, a common regulatory policy is Net Metering, with each state having its own rules and regulations.
  
#### United States Energy, Census, and GDP 2010-2014
This data includes consumption and production of coal, biomass energy, electric energy, geothermal energy, and hydroelectric energy, and natural gas. The data is covered yearly by state.

#### US States by Carbon-Dioxide Emissions Per Capita
This data includes carbon-dioxide emission per capita by state. This data was added to educating tool.

More data has been used to improve the applet and the analysis.
Blue and Red state data was included from 2012. Blue represents a Democratic state, while Red represents a Republican state.
